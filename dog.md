## About Me

Hi. I'm **Scully**—I’m a German Shepherd mix with a job to do.  
I’m in training to become a full-fledged **service dog**, which means I’m working hard to be calm, focused, and ready to help.

I like chicken, loud squeaky toys, and long walks where I can practice ignoring distractions (like squirrels... but no promises).

Please don’t pet me without asking—it’s not personal. I love meeting people, but I’m trying to stay sharp.

## Service Dog Status

> *“The truth is out there. And I’m training to sniff it out.”*

Scully is currently a **Service Dog in Training**, which means she's learning how to support her handler in various public and private environments. Training includes obedience, socialization, situational desensitization, and response behavior.

If you see her working, **please do not pet, distract, or feed** her. Eye contact and compliments are fine—but respect the mission.
